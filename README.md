# RimworldShaders

## Summary

This document aims to provide a brief, yet thorough enough guide to understanding shaders within the context of modding RimWorld. This is not a document detailing the creation of shaders, merely their use cases in the game and what you can do with them as they are. We will cover the properties (fields in a shader file you have access to and can alter to make the shader behave a certain way), a surface-level breakdown of each shaderâ€™s logic, examples of each being used in vanilla if applicable, and how each shader could be used in your own mod.
